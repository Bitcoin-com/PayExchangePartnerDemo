# PayExchangePartnerDemo

##  Demo server simulating the exchange
This server simulated the exchange part. Currently everything is hardcoded so it does not check current market price. The hotwallet address is also hard coded for the sake of the demo.

## Running it
To run it you need to have port 8080 available.

After starting the server, you can run the python script to test it.

`mvn clean install`

`java -jar ExampleExchange-0.1.jar`
